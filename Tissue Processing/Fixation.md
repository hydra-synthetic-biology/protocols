0. Preserved Hydra Tissue

Data
---
N/A

Materials and Supplies
---

0. Hydra Culture Medium
0. 2% urethane in Hydra Culture Medium
0. 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in Hydra Culture Medium

Equipment
---

0. 12-well Picrotiter Plate
0. Light Box
0. Pasteur pipette

Procedure
---

0. Put polyps that have not been fed for 24 hours into a 12-well microtiter plate (up to 20 animals per well)
0. Remove Hydra medium and replace with a solution of 2% urethane in Hydra medium. Incubate on a light box at room temperature for 40-60 seconds (don’t incubate longer than this, as it damages the tissue).
0. Using a Pasteur pipette, squirt about 2 mls of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in Hydra medium into each well
0. Save the unused portion of the 4% paraformaldehyde solution at 4°C for refixation
0. Incubate the animals in the PFA solution at 4°C overnight.

Workflow Information
---

This protocol may be used after prefered dissection or on whole animals. Typically this protocol precedes any immunostaining or in situ hybridizations.
