===

Seperates the endoderm from the ectoderm.

Inputs
---
0. Hydra Polyp

Outputs
---

0. Seperated Endoderm
0. Seperated Ectoderm

Data
---

0. Weight (grams)
0. Length (cm)

Materials and Supplies
---
0. Hydra dissociation medium
0. Hydra culture medium, PH adjusted to 2.5
0. H2O

Equipment
---

0. Dissection Scissors
0. Forceps
0. Dissection Petri Dish
0. Eppendorf Tube

Procedure (~15 minutes)
---

0. Amputate the head by cutting just below the tenantacle whorl.
0. Amputate the lower body by cutting just above the budding zone.
0. Transfer body columns into and Eppendorf tube on ice containing pH 2.5 culture medium for 2 minutes.
0. Gently transfer the treated tissue to dissociation medium in a new eppendorph tube at room temperature.
0. The ectoderm should contract into a ring shape and the endoderm should contract into a rod. Separate the two with fine forceps.

Workflow Information
---

This protocol is used to separate endoderm and ectoderm tissue layers in Hydra vulgaris for using in biophysical measurements and aggregate preparation.

Proceed with aggregate preperation protocol or biophysical measurements.
