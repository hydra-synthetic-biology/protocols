Procedure (30mins)
---
0. Prepare petri dish with 10ml Hydra Medium with 10ml dissociation medium 
0. Place hydra into a petri dish with 50% Dissociation medium
0. Using a razor or scalpel cut the head off of the hydra and place back into original dish
0. Using the razor cut the hydra into 2 - 4 discs (Top of body collumn, middle (can be split into upper and lower), lower body collumn which includes foot)
0. OPTIONAL: using the razor cut 1 - 4 discs into into halves or quarters (see picture)
0. If imaging immediately proceed to slide mounting and regeneration Imaging, Else 
0. Fill as many wells of a 96 well plate halfway with hydra medium as you have pieces of hydra
0. Place each piece into an individual well of a 96 well plate, beginning with the piece originally closest to the head (each row should consist of a single hydra)
0. Place in 18C incubator
0. If imaging immediately mount hydra piece to be imaged on a microscope slide
0. Take 3 100um spacers and peel adhesive paper from proctive sheets on both sides and place onto new microscope slide
0. Collect the hydra piece thatis to be imaged with a pasteur pipette and place no more that 1 drop, including hydra, into the center of the spacer.
0. Take a cover slip and genlty drop onto the cover the spacer.

After this protocol proceed to regeneration vsualization.
