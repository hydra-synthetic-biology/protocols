0. Hydra Dissociation Medium (DM)
0. Ice

Equipment

0. 1000ul Pippeteman
0. 1000up Pippete Tips
0. 1.5ml Eppendorph Tube
0. Centrifuge
0. 96 well V-bottom Plate 

Procedure
---
0. Place 20 pieces of either endoderm or ectoderm in 1 mL DM.
0. Exchange DM 3x to clean the tissue pieces.
0. Incubate on endoderm on ice for 5-10 minutes and ectoderm for 1 hour.
0. Dissociate the cells by gentle shearing with blue pipette tip. Titrate until you can no longer see any pieces floating around.
0. Centrifuge for 5 minutes at 200 g to sediment the cells.
0. Resuspend in 300 ÂµL DM by gently titrating with a blue tip pipette.
0. Centrifuge the suspension in a 96 well v-bottom plate at 1000 g for 5 minutes.
