Transformation Confirmation
===

Visualization protocol to confirm succesful transformation of hydra. 

Inputs
---
0. Unconfirmed Hydra Strain

Outputs
---
0. Confirmed Hydra Strain

Data
---
0. Number of Transgenic cells in each individual hydra
0. Total number of transgenic cells
0. Average number of transgenic cells per transgenic hydra
0. number of transgenic hydra
0. tiff image

Other Materials and Supplies
---
0. Microscope slides
0. Cover slips
0. Spacers

Equipment
---
0. Nikon Inverted Microscope

Procedure (Approximate Duration)
---
0. Mount unconfirmed hydra strain onto microscope slide 
0. Bring slides to microscope
0. Invert the slide and place onto the microscope stage
0. Turn on Fluorescent Lamp (picture)
0. Turn on Shutter Controller and make sure it is set to auto (picture)
0. Turn on Brightfield Lamp Controller (picture)
0. Turn on Turn on Microscope (picture)
0. Turn on XY Controller (picture)
0. Turn on Z Controller(picture)
0. Open Nikon Elements Software
0. When software has opened select the GFP Channel and adjust the picture setting to visualize hydra
0. Bring the hydra into focus
0. When a Hydra is in focus use the xy controller to look around the entire hydra counting the number of transgenic cells in that hydra (picture). As you image keep track of how many hydra contain transgenic cells.
0. Enter number of transgenic cells
0. If this hydra has never been imaged click the "capture image" button. 
0. To save this file create a new folder titled with the item number
0. Save the image with the following file name format: MMDDYY_Itemnumber_Imagenumber
0. Repeat for all hydra on this slide
0. Enter number of hydra that contained transgenic cells
0. Repeat for all Slides

Workflow Information
---
This protocol takes the output of any transformation protocol (electroporation, lipofection, PEI), it can also take the output of colonize hydra. 

The output of this protocol can be used in all of the husbandry protocols and the transformation protocols. Anything that takes hydra as an input
