Inputs

0. Outputs

Data
---
0. Pictures should be in TIFF format. 
0. The number of hydra that are still alive should be counted and recorded
0. If any budding has occured and its location (in a transgenic area?) should be recorded
0. The number of hydra that are expressing the reporter transgene should be recorded
0. The number of cells expressing the reporter transgene should be recorded

0. Nikon Microscope 

Procedure (Approximate Duration)
---
0. Turn on Fluorescent Lamp (picture)
0. Turn on Shutter Controller and make sure it is set to auto (picture)
0. Turn on Brightfield Lamp Controller (picture)
0. Turn on Turn on Microscope (picture)
0. Turn on XY Controller (picture)
0. Turn on Z Controller(picture)
0. Open NIS Elements software by clicking on the icon (picture)
0. Make sure the objective lens is set to 10X (picture)
0. Make sure the microsope slide stage insert is correctly inserted onto the stage (picture)
0. Place the slide cover slip down onto the slide stage
0. Make sure lights are off
0. Adjust light direction so that it is guided towards the eypiece (picture)
0. Turn on the brightfield lamp andjust brightness to your liking (picture)
0. Using the XY controller and focusing knobs find a hydra and bring into focus (picture)
0. In the elements software click on the highcopy GFP tab near the top of the screen. (picture)
0. Next click on the button labeled EPI near the top left of the Elements software. This opens the shutter allowing the laser to pass through the objective (picture) 
0. Look through the eyepiece first to identify GFP expressing cells on selected hydra.
0. Turn light direction knob to redirect light lowards the camera (picture)
0. In Elements click on the "play" button near the top left. (picture)
0. In the window that open click on the auto-scale button near the top of the window (picture)
0. If the picture does not come in clear enough adjust adjust the gain and exposure times manually (picture)
0. Once the picture has come in clear click the camera button near the play button at the top of the elements software window (picture)
0. Go to FILE > Save Image As
0. Save the file as Plate# Well# Hydra # (THIS WILL LIKELY CHANGE)
0. Close the image and repeat for all hydra
0. Upon completion of imaging
