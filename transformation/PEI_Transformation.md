Procedure (1hr)
---

0. Label 2 epp tubes with Item Number and an "A" and "B".
0. In Tube A pippette X ul DNA and in Tube B pippette X ul PEI + X ul diH2O to 25ul total (3:1 ratio of PEI to DNA in ug)
0. Pippette the contents of Tube B slowly into Tube A 
0. Incubate the PEI/DNA for 20 minutes 
0. Collect X number of hydra and place into 25ml dish containing X media(DI H2O, dissociation media, hydra media, PBS etc.)
0. Pour the X media through a 300um filter
0. Invert the 300um filter over the 25ml dish and squirt with X media to collect any detached hydra
0. Fill dish with ~15ml X media 
0. Repeat steps 1 through 4 (not step 0) 6 times.
0. Label new empty epp tubes with Item numbers for transformations. ONce 20 minutes is complete collect the hydra and place 2 into each Item Number labeled tube.
0. Remove X media from Item number labeled tube leaving the hydra behind
0. Pipette the PEI/DNA from Tube A into the Item number labeled tube containing hydra
0. Close the lid and place hydra into 18C incubater and allow to incubate for X hours
0. After X hours use a glass pasteur pipette to collect hydra and place in well of 24 well tray. Add enough hydra media to cover the animals
0. remove hydra media and replace with more hydra media.
0. return to the 18C incubator
