0. sgRNA

Outputs
---
0. Cas9::sgRNA Complex

Data
---
N/A

Other Materials and Supplies
---
0. PCR tube
0. 10ul pipette tips 

Equipment
---
0. Thermocycler
0. Pipettes 

Procedure (Approximate Duration)
---
0. pipette X ul of Cas9 into PCR tube
0. pipette X ul of sgRNA into PCR tube
0. pipette the solution up and down 10 times to ensure proper mixing
0. set the thermocycler to 5mins at 37C 
0. place the PCR tube into the termocycle, close lid and press start
0. when finished retrieve the PCR tube and place in 4C until use
