Procedure (Approximate Duration)
---
0. Collect X number of hydra and place into 25ml dish containing Di H2O and put into 4C for 1hr
0. Remove dish from 4C and carefully swirl the dish.
0. Pour the hydra medium through a 300um filter
0. Invert the 300um filter over the 25ml dish and squirt with hydra medium to collect any detached hydra
0. Fill dish with ~15ml hydra media 
0. Repeat steps 1 through 4 (not step 0) 6 times.
0. On the last iteration fill dish with 15ml chilled 1xPBS and place in 4C for 15mins
0. Prepare enough electroporation media for each set of 5 hydra to be electroporated (1 electroporation event includes 275ul Di H2O + plasmid, 125ul HM (2.75:1.25))
0. pippette 400ul of electroporation media into empty cuvette on ice.
0. enter desired voltage into electroporater 
0. place cuvette containing just electroporation media into electroporater
0. press pulse button twice (you should hear a beep)
0. Press the "time constant" button once. (pulse length should = 3.5 to 6ms. If pulse length lands outside slot remake the electroporation media)
0. Remove dish from 4C
0. Collect hydra and place up to 5 hydra into empty 1.5 ml epp tubes on ice
0. Remove 1xPBS leaving hydra behind
0. add electroporation media into each tube 
0. use pippette to transfer hydra and media to chilled cuvette sitting on ice.
0. enter desired voltage into electroporater 
0. place cuvette containing hydra into electroporater
0. press pulse button twice (you should hear a beep)
0. Press the "time constant" button once and record the pulse length in milliseconds (pulse length should = 3.5 to 6ms. If pulse length lands outside slot dispose of hydra. if outside slot 5 consecutive times restart the protocol)
0. remove cuvette
0. fill cuvette with hydra media 
0. use glass pipette to remove hydra from cuvette and place into a well of a 12 well plate
0. place into 18C incubator
