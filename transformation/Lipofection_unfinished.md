Procedure (Approximate Duration)
---
0. using a glass pippette, aquire X hydra and place in a petri dish
0. fill dish with low pH hydra media and place in 18C incubator for 1hr
0. Label 2 epp tubes as (Item Number)A and (Item Number)B
0. in tube A, first pipette Hydra Media (1ulDNA:50ulHydraMedia) then pippette Xul Plasmid
0. in tube B, first pipette Hydra Media equal to tube A and Lipid transformation reagent equal to DNA
0. Pippete the contents of tube A into tube B and mix by pipetting up and down 10 times.
0. incubate this solution at room temperature for 30minutes
0. Remove dish from 18C and carefully swirl the dish
0. Pour the hydra medium through a 300um filter
0. Invert the 300um filter over the 25ml dish and squirt with hydra medium to collect any detached hydra
0. Fill dish with ~15ml hydra media 
0. Repeat steps 1 through 4 (not step 0) 6 times.
0. Place hydra into an empty well of a 24 well plate and remove hydra media
0. add the contents of tube B to the well over the hydra
0. fill the well up to 1mL with hydra media
0. place into 18C for Xhours 
0. After X hours remove liquid from well and replace with fresh hydra media
